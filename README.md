# TJ Weather Website

> In this project I built a simple website that provides weather information when given a location.

![screenshot](../master/screenshot.png)

The site is built using Node.js and the Express.js server and its hosted on heroku. The site uses data from mapbox.com and darksky.net to give you accurate and reliable information about the weather of your chosen location. 

All you need to do is input your location or any location you wish to get weather information about into the search bar and you get a impressive information about the weather of your given location.
